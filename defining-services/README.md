# Information/steps required to define E-RIHS Services.

> [!TIP]
> Once you have considered the following list of information that may need to be prepared/gathered before devining a E-RIHS Service use the [E-RIHS Service Registration tool](https://e-rihs.io/register-services/) to get step-by-step guidance in defining your services and filling in the relevant forms.

> [!NOTE]
> Multilingual options are being discussed and considered - but at this time the forms are all in English.

## Steps to Register

1. Get your ORCID - if you do not have one then it is free to register at: [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)
2. Go to: [https://e-rihs.io/register-services/?step=2](https://e-rihs.io/register-services/?step=2) read the instructions to register your ORCID details in the E-RIHS knowledge base.
3. You will then receive an email to inform you that you have been fully registered.
4. Login to [https://e-rihs.io/register-services](https://e-rihs.io/register-services) with your ORCID details.
5. Click through all of the 9 steps indicated at the top of the landing page and read the help text on each page.

You will now need to gather together the information required to fill in the various forms offered in the E-RIHS knowledge base for the required Organisations, People, Software, Equipment, Methods, and Services.

## Required Information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The purpose of the collected metadata is to help prospective service users identify appropriate service for their research questions and provide context to the supported projects and the various datasets they will produce. So improving the quality of your Service description can improve the number of potential users.
> 
> Each of the forms include comments, as needed, for the various metadata fields, which should make them relativly straightforward to fill in. However, some details may need to be gathered or checked before one starts to fill them in and then have been noted below.

### Organisations

> [!NOTE]
> The primary Organisation for the registered user will have been created as part of the initial registration process but this should be checked and enhanced as needed. Additional organisations may need to be added depending on your service and team members. Also, when organisations which are part of larger organisations users may need to define the relevant parent or parents as well.

#### Organisation Metadata that may need to be prepared/gathered beforehand
- Organisation Acronym and Name
- Any existing **External PIDs** (Persistent Identifiers). It is recommended that if there is a [ROR](https://ror.org/) or [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) entry for your organisation then these should always be provided to link in additional data such as locations. External references should be provided as URLs.
- Relevant contact details and website links
- Consider the **Research Disciplines** covered by the Organisation - at least one is required, but more can be added - there is a big drop down list but there is also an option to add more specific terms if required. You can also see the current full list here: [Research Disciplines](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11158/0002-9dc3-7d05-b211?urlappend=%26simple)
- If the organisation needs to be referenced in a particular form such as EU project requiring a grant number to be included you will need to include this information.
- To help users understand an orgabisations level of experience some dates relating to when the organisation started working in this field and when it began to work with the E-RIHS community should also be provided.
- A short bio is also useful.

### People

> [!NOTE]
> The primary user will already have had a person record created for them as part of the initial registration process but this should be checked and enhanced as needed. All people involved with a service team will need to be entered as people into the E-RIHS knowledge base. This is important for future E-RIHS service users to be able to see the range and experience of the services team when they are selecting E-RIHS services.

#### Person Metadata that may need to be prepared/gathered beforehand
- The person's Title and Name
- Any existing external persistent identifiers such as as an [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/) this is not a required field but it is strongly recommended.
- Their affiliations with any defined Organisations and the date they started working with them.
- Relevant contact details and website links
- Consider the research disciplines covered by the Person - there is a big drop down list but there is also an option to add more specific terms if required. You can also see the current full list here: [Research Disciplines](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11158/0002-9dc3-7d05-b211?urlappend=%26simple)
- Finally the date they started working in this field.
- A short bio is also useful.

### Software or Equipment (Tools)

> [!NOTE]
> Only the key systems, pieces of equipment and software used with your services need to be defined.
>
> The set-up of software and equipment offered in a service can range from simple or complex. A simple set-up involves a simple software or equipment offered that can be directly described here. In case of more complex set-ups there are two approaches that can be used: 

1. Describing “component” parts of software and equipment. Components need to be described as software and equipment and can afterwards be linked as components within a parent or **main** tool.
2. Describing individual software and equipment that are mentioned in the method description (see next step). 

#### Software or Equipment (Tools) Metadata that may need to be prepared/gathered beforehand
##### Software and Equipment will need to have:

- A unique title and a description - the title should generally relate to your own setup rather than a simple model name. A good approach will be to start with the acronym of your organisation such as “KIK-IRPA Raman 785/532 No1”.
- You will need to enter the relevant general data output or input types. The dropboxes give a number of options but you can add your own or adjust an existing term if required.
- A last checked date is also required, this is related to checking a system is working but for the initial definition this will generally be the current date.

##### Software

- You will also need relevant developer/company details, licence type, version number, and release date.
- It is also very useful to include relevant links to code, documentation, forums etc.
- At this stage the only details within the software description covering the input and output data used by software is the general class or type such as “2d dataset” or “RGB image”. Detailed information relating to formats file sizes etc. can all be added later in relation to a Method statement or as part of a Data Management Plan.

##### Equipment

- You will also need relevant Manufacturer details, model number, serial number, and calibration date.
- It is also very useful to include relevant links to documentation or equipment websites.
- You will also be asked to select a working distance range and indicate the possible impact the equipment might have on an object or sample.
- Details of possible acquisition or target areas are also required. The dropbox gives a number of options but you can add your own or adjust an existing term if required.

### Methods (Protocol)

> [!NOTE]
> These are intended to be a standard or general description of Methods not the specific approach for a given experiment or piece of analysis. These more specific details will be explored later but will be linked to and or derived from the relevant standard method. Methods are related to how different techniques are applied within a service. Also please note a Method can range from a simple text description of the usual activities within an ARCHLAB service to a detailed set of key parameters needed within complex systems used within MOLAB or FIXLAB. A detailed textual description of the steps carried out within a Method can be directly included in the form or referenced as an external document as needed.

#### Method Metadata that may need to be prepared/gathered beforehand
- A unique title which should relate to your own Method rather than a general name. A good approach will be to start with the acronym of your organisation followed by a short descriptive phrase and potentially a date or version number for example “KIK-IRPA Raman analysis of paint cross sections 2024”.
- Alternative shorter acronyms can also be entered such as “KIK-IRPA Raman 2024”
- The relevant technique - this can be selected from a big controlled list of [techniques](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11158/0002-d6f1-f86f-d248?urlappend=%26simple)) but “other” more specialised techniques can also be defined.
- A version number for the method - this can be a simple number more complex semantic versioning or even just the year the method was created.
- Creation date
- Relevant author details - this will need to be a referenced person or organisation already in the E-RIHS Knowledge base.
- The related tools (software or equipment previously registered in the E-RIHS knowledge base) should be listed along with their role within the method.
- A textual description of the Method can be added as free text or linked as an existing published document.
- A list of key parameters can then be added each one will have value, unit, and type. They can also be linked to specific (previously registered) tools if a method is related to a complex multi-tool setup.
- The parameter type and unit dropboxes give a number of options but you can add your own or adjust an existing term if required. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The purpose of the list of method parameters is to define the key terms needed for data interpretation and or to aid future searches for relevant data sets. It does not need to be an exhaustive list of every possible parameter used within a system, this will often be imbeded with the created datasets.

### Services

> [!NOTE]
> Key metadata directly describing a service relates to the technology/technique used, the Access platform (MOLAB, FIXLAB, ARCHLAB, DIGILAB) to which it belongs, domains or disciplines a given service has worked within or has experience within, the types of objects or data to which it applies (research focus), the precise functions it can offer, the materials or properties for which it provides information.
>
> All the detailed information for the complete definition of an E-RIHS service which constitutes the identity if not the uniqueness of the service is a combination of the Service description and all of the linked details describing the previously documented related entities (people, organisation, tools (equipment, software)) see model diagram.

#### Service Metadata that may need to be prepared/gathered beforehand

- A unique title which should relate to your Service rather than just a technique or piece of equipment. A good approach will be to start with the acronym of your organisation followed by a short descriptive phrase for example “Access to KIK-IRPA Archives”.
- A Service summary - this should be a very short paragraph that defines the service. This is intended to be displayed in lists of services rather than to provide too much detail. It can include concepts like using X to identify or study Y or “providing access to and collaborative research support for archive X.
- A full Service description: this is a full general description of your service. It is intended to explain the scope of what the service is for as well as describing what is special or unique to your service and why relevant users want to apply for it.
- Support activities: Details of any organisations (previously defined) in the system that provide support for your service.
- The fields Research Discipline, typical Research Questions, and Service Function are all intended to help users search for and identify the correct Services to answer their research questions. Please take some time to consider the best values to provide.
- Collections, Objects, Samples, and Archives: Some services can provide access to specific research resources such as heritage collections, objects, samples, archives etc. these can be described with simple text or referenced with a URL.
- Service Limitations: this is an optional text field to describe any limitations a given service might have. This could relate to sample or object size/weight, perhaps the available environmental conditions or even limited opening hours. As more services are defined this field will be re-assessed to determine if some form of controlled list might be more useful or even if further information might be required.
- There is an option to reference example output datasets (or example input datasets for DIGILAB) data via a URL (DOI). A further text field (Service Output Description) is also provided later in the form to allow service providers to describe in more detail the outputs or results of a service, what reports, images, datasets will be produced and in what formats. Similarly for digital services, details if required a Service Input Description can also be provided.
- A service version (and related date) can be defined - this is important to help distinguish between data produced by a single “service” but at different times with potentially different team members or equipment.
- A service creation date can also be defined - this relates to when the service has actually been offered as a service (but this can have been before E-RIHS was formed, in a previous EU project or even at a more local National or Institutional level. This field is intended to help potential service users understand the experience behind a given service.
- As E-RIHS develops, making use of clear Data Management Plans will become increasingly important. This will ensure that potential users understand how created data will be managed, sustained, and shared. If these details have already been established they can be entered or linked to the service. If not then the Service record will probably need to be updated at a later stage before they can be added to a specific Catalogue of Services.
- An optional data flow diagram can also be included for more complex services involving multiple stages or pieces of equipment or a variety of data processing steps.
- The final few fields are more administrative - relating to the access period (the period of time used to define the length of a service access) and a potential unit cost of a service per period. This has traditionally been in days or hours but when considering future digital services smaller time periods may be required.
